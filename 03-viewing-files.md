# Viewing Files and File Content

## What it is
Linux provides multiple commands to view the contents of files without modifying them.

## Common commands practiced
```bash
cat
less
more
head
tail

## Command overview
- `cat` displays the entire file content at once
- `less` allows scrolling through large files safely
- `more` displays content page by page
- `head` shows the first lines of a file
- `tail` shows the last lines of a file

## Why it matters in cybersecurity
Security analysts frequently inspect configuration files, logs, and output files. Using safe viewing commands prevents accidental file modification.

## Key takeaway
Knowing how to read files efficiently is essential for system analysis and troubleshooting.
