# Files and Directories

## What it is
Linux uses a hierarchical file system where everything is treated as a file, including directories and devices.

## Common commands practiced
```bash
pwd
ls
mkdir
touch
cp
mv
rm

## Files vs Directories
- Files store data
- Directories organize files in a structured way

## Absolute vs Relative paths
- Absolute path starts from the root directory `/`
- Relative path starts from the current working directory

## Why it matters in cybersecurity
Security professionals often need to navigate the file system to locate configuration files, logs, binaries, and sensitive data.

## Key takeaway
Efficient file and directory management is a core Linux skill.
